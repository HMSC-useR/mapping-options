# mapping-options
This repository contains the files for the HMSC-useR February 2015 meeting presentation that provided an overview of R packages that can be used to create maps, by Daniel Palacios, 10 Feb 2015.

The source code is contained in mapping_hmsc_useR.Rmd, an R Markdown file. To use it, you need the 'knitr' and 'markdown' packages installed in RStudio. Other required packages specific to the presentation are documented in the source file.

To build the presentation in R, run knit2html("mapping_hmsc_useR.Rmd"), or use the 'knit_HTML' button in Rstudio.
